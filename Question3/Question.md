3. (30 pts) Coding is converting a string to a sequence of 0 's and 1 's which is called the code of this string. A coding is called `decodable` if any code generated by this coding can be reversed to the original string. To prevent ambiguities in decoding, a "prefix rule" needs to be satisfied. The prefix rule states that no code is a prefix of another code. To encode English words, designing a coding for letters is a typical step. In this problem, we concentrate on designing a coding for the `26` letters without considering **uppercase** and **lowercase** (i.e. a, b, ..., z ). A straightforward coding for the letters is to use 5-digit binaries (e.g. `00000` for a `00001` for, b, and `00010` for c ). This type of coding is called `fixed-length coding`. This coding, though very simple, may not be inefficient in terms of the lengths of resulting codes. Typically, the resulting codes are expected to be as short as possible in average. It can be observed that, in a given document, the frequencies of letters can be significantly different. Intuitively, if the codes for frequent letters are shorter than the codes for infrequent letters, then the average length of codes of words is reduced. This type of coding is called `variable-length coding`.

- For example, given a sentence `"fanchao is a super cool person"`, the letters o, a and s are more frequent than others, and their codes can be designed to be shorter than others. Note that, when designing variable-length coding methods, the frequencies of letters are needed beforehand. And typically these frequencies are obtained from considered documents. In this problem, we consider the sentence `"fanchao is a super cool person"` as the given document. Please design a variable-length and decodable coding for the letters occurring in this document. Your coding is required to outperform the fixed-length coding (i.e. using 4-digit binaries to encode letters). Please justify that your coding is decodable. Please justify that your coding outperforms the 4-digit fixed-length coding.
